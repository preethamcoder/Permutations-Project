# PermutationsProject

I decided to solve a problem where a user would get distinct permuations of the letters of a word given the word.
In my app, for the sake of simplicity, I have assumed that lowercase and uppercase letters are the same. 
I will modify this aspect very soon.

I can also include an aspect where the user will like to count them as distinct.
